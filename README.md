## Cohesion
I created this game for fun in summer 2005 when I was 15 years old, so please don't be too harsh when evaluating it.

### Rules
Get to the door on the other side of screen.
You die if you drop more than two squares.
It is possible to climb only one square. Some blocks can be moved, some will explode (disappear) if they touch together.


### Controls
* Move left and right by arrows.
* To climb up push first the up arrow and then the right arrow.
* Reload the map by 'R' key.
* To load specific level (1-8 available) push the corresponding number on keyboard.

### Hidden bug
There is a bug in the game, usually after playing for approximately 10 minutes it crashes. I will be very happy if someone attempts to fix it.

### Contributions
Please feel free to improve or modify the game.
